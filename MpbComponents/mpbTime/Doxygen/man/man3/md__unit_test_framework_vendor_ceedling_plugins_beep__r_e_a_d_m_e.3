This is a simple plugin that just beeps at the end of a build and/or test sequence\&. Are you getting too distracted surfing the internet, chatting with coworkers, or swordfighting while it's building or testing? The friendly beep will let you know it's time to pay attention again\&.

This plugin has very few configuration options\&. At this time it can beep on completion of a task and/or on an error condition\&. For each of these, you can configure the method that it should beep\&.
